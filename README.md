![Library Overview](images/library_overview.png)

## 🧠 Overview

Ever wandered through a library, overwhelmed by the sheer number of books, wondering what to read next? Now imagine the library knows you so well, it can whisper, *“You might also like…”* just like your favorite streaming platform. That's exactly what this project aims to do.

We tried to build a smart recommendation system for the university’s library platform to help students and staff discover books they’ll actually want to read—based on what books they’ve interacted with before, what others like them are reading, and even the hidden magic tucked inside book metadata.

Our system predicts which books each user is most likely to enjoy and presents the **Top 10 personalized recommendations**. We used a mix of techniques like collaborative filtering and text embeddings to make these suggestions as accurate and interesting as possible.

💡 **Goal**: Score a Precision@10 above 0.1452 and climb the leaderboard by helping students fall in love with their next read.
